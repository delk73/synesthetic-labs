# Synesthetic Labs Backlog (v0.1 â†’ v0.2)

- Add MCP adapter integration tests that exercise schema validation responses end-to-end.
- Expand generator catalogue to support shader, tone, and haptic specialisations.
- Implement lifecycle orchestration scaffolding for replaying proposals against archived datasets.
- Capture richer telemetry (timings, config hashes) in meta/output/ for downstream analytics.
- Author audit automation that keeps `meta/output/labs_state.md` synced with repository changes.
