      "MCP validation MUST be invoked in all modes (strict and relaxed); skipping validation is a non-compliant divergence",
      "TCP MUST be the default transport when MCP_ENDPOINT is unset/invalid; socket is OPTIONAL and may be skipped in CI if documented",
      "Labs MUST call MCP for schema validation via STDIO, socket, or TCP; any local fallback is a non-compliant divergence",
      "Labs MUST log generator, critic, patch, MCP, and external generator interactions with reason/detail on failures; silent failures are non-compliant",
      "Unused/legacy env vars (e.g., backend knobs) MUST be removed or documented as deprecated; otherwise mark Divergent",
