# Generator v0.2 Stage 2 — Assembler Audit

## Overview
The audit reviewed the newly added `AssetAssembler` and its associated tests to confirm that individual component generators are wired into a complete Synesthetic asset without dangling references. Source inspection and the existing pytest suite were used as evidence; targeted reruns of `pytest tests/test_generator_assembler.py tests/test_generator_e2e.py -q` were attempted but blocked by the current sandbox configuration.

## Checks
| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assembler gathers `input_parameters` from shader/tone/haptic sections and uses them to gate cross-component wiring | Pass | `labs/generator/assembler.py:59`-`92` collects parameters via `_collect_parameters` and relies on them when pruning controls, modulations, and rule effects. |
| Control mappings only reference valid parameters | Pass | `labs/generator/assembler.py:106`-`115` ensures controls survive only when their `parameter` is in the shared index; baseline mappings in `labs/generator/control.py:8`-`33` all target declared parameters. Tests in `tests/test_generator_assembler.py:54`-`58` assert the invariant. |
| Modulation targets exist on shader/tone/haptic surfaces | Pass | `_prune_modulators` in `labs/generator/assembler.py:117`-`126` filters by parameter index; fixtures validated in `tests/test_generator_assembler.py:60`-`61`. |
| Rule bundle effects reference valid parameters | Pass | `_prune_rule_bundle` in `labs/generator/assembler.py:128`-`148` drops effects targeting unknown parameters; coverage in `tests/test_generator_assembler.py:63`-`67`. |
| Final asset passes MCP schema validation when CriticAgent runs | Not Run (MCP unavailable) | `tests/test_generator_assembler.py:70`-`75` attempts live MCP validation but skips when `MCP_HOST/MCP_PORT/SYN_SCHEMAS_DIR` are missing or the adapter is offline. No MCP endpoint was configured during this audit. |
| Integration tests assert no dangling references | Pass | `tests/test_generator_assembler.py:46`-`75` exercises assembled payloads and enforces reference integrity. |
| E2E harness (assembler → critic → MCP) runs and logs outputs | Pass (with mocked MCP) | `tests/test_generator_e2e.py:13`-`44` drives AssetAssembler output through `CriticAgent` with a stub validator, persisting JSON + JSONL artifacts. |

## Action Items
- Provide a reachable MCP adapter (set `MCP_HOST`, `MCP_PORT`, and `SYN_SCHEMAS_DIR`) so the validation test in `tests/test_generator_assembler.py` can execute rather than skip, satisfying the schema-validation check.

## Status
Pass, contingent on the noted MCP validation gap.
