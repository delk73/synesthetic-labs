# Audit Report — Synesthetic Labs v0.1

## Summary of repo state
- Generator and critic agents ship as lightweight classes with JSONL logging.
- CLI exposes deterministic `generate` and `critique` subcommands for manual use.
- Tests, Docker harness, and CI workflow all exercise the pipeline with pytest.

## Top gaps & fixes
- Introduce schema-aware validation once MCP adapters are available.
- Add a CLI pipeline command that chains generator and critic automatically.
- Broaden prompts and datasets to cover richer review scenarios.

## Alignment with labs_spec.md
| Spec item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generator agent present under `labs/agents/generator.py` | Present | Implements `GeneratorAgent` with UUID + timestamp logging |
| Critic agent present under `labs/agents/critic.py` | Present | Performs key validation and logging |
| CLI exposes generator → critic operations | Present | `labs/cli.py` subcommands |
| Tests cover generator, critic, pipeline | Present | `tests/test_generator.py`, `tests/test_critic.py`, `tests/test_pipeline.py` |
| Docker harness + docker-compose run pytest | Present | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `test.sh` |
| README references labs_spec.md | Present | Quickstart section links to spec |

## Test coverage
| Feature | Tested? | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generator logging and validation | Yes | `tests/test_generator.py` |
| Critic validation outcomes | Yes | `tests/test_critic.py` |
| Generator → critic integration | Yes | `tests/test_pipeline.py` |

## Dependencies and runtime
| Package | Used in | Required/Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pytest | Testing across `tests/` | Required |

## Environment variables
- None required; defaults in code paths operate without configuration.

## Documentation accuracy
- README quickstart mirrors labs_spec expectations and points to `docs/labs_spec.md`.
- Backlog tracks post-v0.1 enhancements.

## Detected divergences
- None.

## Recommendations
- Implement schema-backed MCP validation before expanding beyond v0.1.
- Capture additional provenance (e.g., CLI parameters) in logs to aid audits.
- Automate combined pipeline execution as a CLI subcommand for ease of use.
