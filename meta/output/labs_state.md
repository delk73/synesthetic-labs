# Synesthetic Labs Audit Snapshot (v0.1)

Provenance: generated from `meta/prompts/audit.json` after implementing the
minimal generator → critic workflow.

## Summary of repo state
- Generator and critic agents emit structured JSON records and log to JSONL sinks.
- CLI exposes `generate` and `critique` subcommands with JSON stdout output.
- Tests, Docker harness, and CI workflow exercise the pipeline with `pytest`.

## Top gaps & fixes
- Add CLI smoke tests to cover the JSON stdout contract.
- Expand provenance metadata with optional user/session tags for experiments.
- Provide sample prompt assets or fixtures demonstrating expected prompt content.

## Alignment with labs_spec.md
| Spec item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GeneratorAgent emits proposal with id/timestamp/prompt/provenance | Present | `labs/agents/generator.py`
| CriticAgent validates keys and adds ok/issues fields | Present | `labs/agents/critic.py`
| CLI provides generate/critique commands printing JSON | Present | `labs/cli.py`
| Pytest suite covers generator, critic, pipeline | Present | `tests/test_*.py`
| Container + CI harness run pytest -q | Present | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Test coverage
| Feature | Tested? | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generator logging and schema | Yes | `tests/test_generator.py`
| Critic validation outcomes | Yes | `tests/test_critic.py`
| End-to-end generator → critic | Yes | `tests/test_pipeline.py`

## Dependencies and runtime
| Package | Used in | Required/Optional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pytest | Test suite and CI | Required

## Environment variables
- None required; both agents infer default log paths under `meta/output/`.

## Documentation accuracy
- `README.md` instructions match the available CLI, tests, and harness.
- `docs/labs_spec.md` captures the implemented behaviour and tooling list.

## Detected divergences
- None; implementation matches the v0.1 specification.

## Recommendations
- Version the JSONL log format if new metadata fields are introduced.
- Document example CLI usage demonstrating piping generator output into the critic.
- Consider packaging the CLI via `python -m` entry point metadata for distribution.
