# **Use Case Brief: Shared Field Mode Cueing**

**Title:** *Real-Time Multimodal Field Management in Group Interaction*
**Domain:** Synesthetic OS — Perception-Layer Interfaces
**Version:** Draft v0.1

---

## **Overview**

This use case explores how Synesthetic OS can support **three or more people in a shared space** by providing **real-time, multimodal cues** of interpersonal *field modes* (Catalyst, Gatekeeper, Integrator).
The system projects **simple, ambient signals** across visual, auditory, and haptic channels to maintain rhythm, perception, and alignment of group dynamics.

---

## **Problem**

* In live collaboration, participants often unconsciously drift into conflicting styles (e.g., all Gatekeeper → stalled, no Integrator → no cohesion).
* Misalignments or “bad landings” (remarks or actions that jar the room) are noticed only after tension escalates.
* Groups lack a **neutral, perception-layer feedback system** to reflect collective state and help self-correct in real time.

---

## **Solution**

Synesthetic OS provides a **field cue layer** that:

1. **Tracks declared/selected modes** of participants (Catalyst, Gatekeeper, Integrator).
2. **Displays simple, ambient visuals** to show each participant’s mode at a glance.
3. **Generates subtle audio rhythms** that entrain group tempo and reflect mode balance.
4. **Delivers haptic feedback** when misalignment or “off-landing” occurs, prompting embodied correction without verbal interruption.

---

## **Modes & Cues**

* **Catalyst**: expanding pulse → upbeat rhythm → light tapping haptic.
* **Gatekeeper**: solid line → steady bass → firm, singular haptic thump.
* **Integrator**: interwoven waves → blended chord → rolling, wave-like haptic.
* **Error/Discord Cue**: ripple buzz + brief visual flash → signals a “bad landing” or field mismatch.

---

## **Workflow**

1. **Initialization**: Participants select or are assigned their starting mode.
2. **Realtime Field Projection**: Shared display and ambient sound reflect active modes.
3. **Interaction Loop**:

   * Visual glyphs pulse with rhythm.
   * Audio underscores tempo and balance.
   * Haptics reinforce personal embodiment of the mode.
4. **Correction**: If something lands wrong (misaligned cue, discordant action), system issues a **field correction ripple** across modalities.
5. **Re-alignment**: Participants adjust their mode or rhythm accordingly.

---

## **Benefits**

* **Perceptual alignment**: Everyone sees/feels where the group is leaning.
* **Immediate feedback**: Missteps corrected at the body level, not just cognitively.
* **Field awareness**: Makes implicit group dynamics explicit in minimal, non-intrusive form.
* **Scalability**: Works with 3 people in a room, or larger groups, without requiring complex visualization.

## **Fit with Synesthetic OS**

This use case demonstrates the OS’s capacity to:

* Operate as a **perception-layer instrument** for social as well as creative contexts.
* Map abstract interpersonal states into **simple multimodal cues**.
* Enable adaptive field management without verbal negotiation, enhancing flow and resilience of collective work.
