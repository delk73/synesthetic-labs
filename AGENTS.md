# Synesthetic Labs State Report (v0.3.5)

## Summary of Repo State

This report summarizes the alignment of the `synesthetic-labs` repository with the v0.3.5 specification. The audit reveals a solid foundation with several key features already implemented. However, there are notable gaps and divergences in areas like schema normalization, MCP validation, and structured logging, indicating that the codebase is in a transitional state.

## Alignment

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `env-preload-v0.3.5` | Present | `dotenv`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `LABS_FAIL_FAST` are used in `labs/cli.py`. |
| `gemini-request-structure-v0.3.5` | Present | Gemini requests correctly include `contents/parts/text` and `generationConfig`. |
| `gemini-response-parse-v0.3.5` | Divergent | Response parsing logic exists, but the literal string `candidates[0].content.parts[0].text` is not present in `labs/generator/external.py`. |
| `normalization-schema-0.7.3-v0.3.5` | Divergent | `labs/generator.py` calls `_normalize_0_7_3` but is missing the explicit `if schema_version == '0.7.3'` check. |
| `normalization-enriched-schema-v0.3.5` | Present | Enriched schema normalization for versions `>= 0.7.4` is correctly implemented. |
| `error-handling-retry-v0.3.5` | Present | Network/server errors are retried, and client errors fail immediately as expected. |
| `structured-logging-v0.3.5` | Divergent | `labs/generator/external.py` uses `log_external_generation` instead of the specified `log_event`. |
| `mcp-validation-flow-v0.3.5` | Divergent | `labs/cli.py` is missing the `invoke_mcp` call, and the corresponding test file is absent. |
| `mcp-version-aware-validator-v0.3.5` | Divergent | The validator in `labs/mcp/validate.py` does not dynamically resolve schema paths based on version. |
| `external-live-toggle-v0.3.5` | Present | The `LABS_EXTERNAL_LIVE` environment variable is correctly used to toggle live API calls. |

## Top Gaps & Fixes

1.  **MCP Integration:** The MCP validation flow is incomplete. The `invoke_mcp` function needs to be implemented in `labs/cli.py`, and `tests/test_cli.py` should be created to verify its functionality.
2.  **Schema Versioning:** The schema normalization logic needs to be updated to be fully version-aware. This includes adding the explicit `if schema_version == '0.7.3'` check in `labs/generator.py` and implementing version-based path resolution in `labs/mcp/validate.py`.
3.  **Logging Consistency:** The structured logging implementation should be standardized. The `log_event` function should be used consistently across the codebase, or the audit rule should be updated to reflect the use of `log_external_generation`.

## Recommendations

*   **Prioritize MCP Integration:** Completing the MCP validation flow is critical for ensuring the integrity of generated assets.
*   **Refactor Schema Handling:** A more robust and centralized approach to schema versioning and resolution will improve maintainability and reduce the likelihood of errors.
*   **Standardize Logging:** Consistent logging practices are essential for effective monitoring and debugging. The development team should agree on a standard logging interface and apply it throughout the codebase.
